# Interviewing

This repository is a personal knowledge base used to prepare for technical and behavioral interviews.
- It contains real engineering stories, distilled from past roles, and structured to highlight decision-making, ownership, and impact.
- Its goal is to reflect thoughtful preparation, clarity of thinking, and professional maturity rather than expose internal details.

## Repository Overview

- `resume/`:  
    - Source files for the resume, kept close to stories to ensure alignment between written experience and spoken narratives.
- `scripts/`:
    - Automation utilities used to keep documentation consistent and up to date.
- `stories/`:
    - Company- or domain-specific interview stories, written in a consistent format.

## How to Use This Repo

### Before an interview
- Skim [stories](./stories.md) to refresh key experiences.
- Use stories as anchors, not scripts.
- Adapt details based on the question being asked rather than reciting memorized answers.

### After interviews
- Refine stories with feedback and reflections.
- Clarify weak points or add missing context revealed by interview questions.
